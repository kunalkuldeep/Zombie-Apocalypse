# Zombie-Apocalypse

While it is unlikely to be a zombie apocalypse will happen in the near future, the information presented in this notebook draws on emergency preparedness recommendations from the CDC. Although there is no way to make ourselves younger, we can have food, water, medication, and other supplies ready to ensure we are safe in the event of a blizzard, flood, tornado, or another emergency. After computing your zombie probability, think about what you could personally do to increase the likelihood that you will stay safe in the next storm or zombie apocalypse
